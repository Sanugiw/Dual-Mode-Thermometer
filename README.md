# 🏥 Dual-Mode Analog Thermometer  

![Project Banner](Images\image.png) <!-- Add an image of your device or schematic if available -->

## 📌 Overview  
The **Dual-Mode Analog Thermometer** is a precision temperature measurement device designed using **analog components** to ensure high accuracy and reliability. Unlike fully digital thermometers, this design utilizes **thermistors, Wheatstone bridges, and an instrumentation amplifier** for precise temperature readings.  

This project was developed as part of the **EN2091 Laboratory Practice and Projects** module in our 3rd semester, focusing on **hands-on circuit design, sensor integration, and analog signal processing**.  

## ⚡ Features  
✅ **Dual-Mode Functionality** – Toggle switch to switch between **body temperature** and **liquid temperature** modes.  
✅ **High Accuracy** – Uses **thermistors, Wheatstone bridges, and an instrumentation amplifier** for precise readings.  
✅ **OLED Display** – Temperature readings are displayed on an **OLED screen**, with an **Arduino** used solely for display purposes.  
✅ **Stable Power Supply** – Converts **AC to +10V, -10V, and 5V** for reliable operation.  
✅ **Future Expansion** – Plans to integrate a **MUX** for additional modes.
